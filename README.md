# TicTacToeMinimax
This is an AI which plays tic tac toe using the minimax algorithm. The minimax algorithm is implemented in Haskell, but it is compiled along with a simple wrapper allowing it to be called from a Python program, where the game loop is implemented. The AI can play as both 'X' and 'O'.
